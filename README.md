# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis and Prediction (Portuguese Dataset)

This project explores and predicts **student performance** using the **Kaggle “Student Performance (Portuguese)” dataset**.  
It applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Deep Learning (MLP)** model to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on demographic, social, and academic factors.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** `student-por.csv` from [Kaggle Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set)
- **Goal:** Predict student pass/fail status (`G3 ≥ 10 → pass`) using demographic and study-related features.
- **Tech Stack:**
  - Python 🐍
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-Learn
  - TensorFlow / Keras
  - Missingno (for missing value visualization)
